I have developed a Streamlit-based book recommendation system that uses data from Movies (title, tags) and after being processed it predicts similarity between other movies and recommend nearest 5 movies.

## Content Base System ðŸ› 

In this, I have used a Content-Base System that uses the attributes/tags/keywords of items in order to make recommendations.

## Collaborative Recommendation System âš™

Collaborative technique predicts on the basis of past users' behaviors

## Hybrid Approach System âš™+ðŸ› 

This technique uses both collaborative and content base approaches to recommend.
